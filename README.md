# Compose Sample

A project template with the following objectives in mind:

* encourage usage of **modern UI** tools
* make it easy to write new features
* optimize for incremental build
* minimize external deps
* encourage creation of a design system

Behind the scenes:

* user interface: compose
* dep injection: hilt
* async: coroutines & flow 
* database: room
* rest apis: retrofit
* coil for image loading
* build:
  - kts gradle scripts
  - buildSrc commons
* features x layer modularization
* design: a demo app to showcase / discuss / help team member onboarding

## Future

A few ideas among others:

* simplify navigation using https://proandroiddev.com/compose-destinations-simpler-and-safer-navigation-in-compose-with-no-compromises-74a59c6b727d
* add chucker network traffic monitor
* track deps versions updates
